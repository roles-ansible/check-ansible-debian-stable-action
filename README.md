 Check Ansible Debian stable
=======================
This action allows you to test your ansible role or your playbook in a Docker Container with ``debian:stable``.

## Usage
To use the action simply create an ``ansible-debian-stable.yml`` *(or choose custom ``*.yml`` name)* in the ``.github/workflows/`` directory.

For example:

```yaml
name: Ansible check debian:stable  # feel free to pick your own name

# yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Important: This sets up your GITHUB_WORKSPACE environment variable
      - name: Checkout git repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: ansible check with debian:stable
      # replace "master" with any valid ref
      uses: roles-ansible/check-ansible-debian-stable-action@master
      with:
          targets: "/github/workspace"
          #  [required]
          #   Paths to your ansible role or playboox.yml you want to test
          #   Some Examples:
          #   targets: "role/my_role/"
          #   targets: "site.yml"
          #
          # group: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks you have to tell ansible
          #   the group you that we write in our hosts file.
          #   example:
          #   group: 'servers'
          #
          # hosts: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks you have to give one example
          #   host this action should use to test your playbook.
          #   > We only spawn one docker container that mean
          #   > we can only test one host at the time. Sorry
          #   some examples:
          #   hosts: 'localhost'
          #   hosts: 'srv01.example.com'
          #
          # requirements: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks and you are using ansible galaxy,
          #   you may be interested in installing your requirements
          #   from ansible galaxy.
          #   To do this please provide us either the role name directly
          #   requirements: 'do1jlr.ansible_version'
          #   or your requiements.yml file.
          #   requirements: 'requirements.yml'
          #
          # tags: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   If you want to limit the test to some tags, you can use this
          #   tags or the skiptags option. It will trigger the --tags $tags
          #   option to ansible.
          #
          # skiptags: ""
          # [optional]
          #  See tags. This will trigger the --skip-tags $skiptags option
          #  to ansible.
```

Alternatively, you can run the ansible check only on certain branches:

```yaml

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - stable
    - main
    - release/v*
```
